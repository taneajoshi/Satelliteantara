## Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite: An Elegant Development Template

This repository provides a head-start for developing with Vue 3 and TypeScript using the efficient Vite build tool. The template takes advantage of Vue 3's `<script setup>` Single File Components (SFCs), delivering a clean and expressive codebase. To learn more about `<script setup>`, visit the [script setup documentation](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup).

## Recommended IDE Setup

To elevate your development experience, we highly recommend the following setup:

- [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/): An exceptional code editor that empowers developers with its versatility and performance.
- [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar): A dedicated plugin designed specifically for Vue.js development. Say goodbye to conflicts and embrace a smoother development workflow.
- [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin): Enhance TypeScript with Vue-specific knowledge for even greater productivity.

To achieve this setup, kindly disable the built-in TypeScript extension and follow these steps:

1. Open the command palette in VS Code and run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions`.
2. Locate `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right-click, and gracefully select `Disable (Workspace)`.
3. After performing these steps, reload the VS Code window with poise by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

## Type Support For `.vue` Imports in TypeScript: A Graceful Solution

TypeScript, by default, encounters challenges when handling type information for `.vue` imports. To overcome this hurdle and ensure a seamless experience, we gracefully replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for impeccable type checking.

In your preferred code editor, this solution requires the aid of the [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to acquaint the TypeScript language service with `.vue` types.

If you desire an even more performant TypeScript experience, Volar introduces a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669). Enable this mode through the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension:
   1. Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VS Code's command palette.
   2. Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right-click, and select `Disable (Workspace)`.
2. Relish the enhanced performance of Take Over Mode by reloading the VS Code window with the utmost sophistication via `Developer: Reload Window` in the command palette.
